# CapsToLower
My first repository. Very simple code: converts the user input from capital letters to lowercase letters.

Why I decided to create this code: 

Sometimes when I am typing, my caps lock turns on and the next few sentences I type are all in caps. Retyping everything takes time so I decided to create this
code to make my life easier. It's just 3 lines of code, but it makes a big difference.
